1.3 billion tons of food are thrown away each year...

That's 170 kg of food each year per Canadian, and akin to throwing out 1/4 of your groceries as soon as you leave the store.

## Introducing Fresh Bite
Our mission? To ensure you are able to keep track of your groceries and consume them before they go bad. Create a profile and track your groceries seamlessly.

By providing such a service, we hope to save you some dollar bills and help the planet a little more each and every day!

### Saving Money % the Environment
While Fresh Bite helps eliminate food waste by providing a well-portioned meal plan to help you get rid of those on-sale groceries you bought in bulk, it also provides a cost-effective solution for lower-income families.

By planning out meals based on the expiration dates of the ingredients, Fresh Bite ensures that your money is well-spent and nothing has to go to waste. It's a win-win scenario.

## Web Development Tools
Made using Bootstrap, HTML/CSS, Node.js, HTTP/FTP, Clarifai API, Food2Fork API and Domain.com, Fresh Bite is a web app integrating user input with machine learning dataset APIs and dynamic information generation.
